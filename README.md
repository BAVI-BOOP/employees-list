### Useful resources

- [W3 Schoold](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for basics of website paradigm. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing document which helped me finally understand deep sides of web development. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning these concepts.
